    <h1>Mental Health</h1>
    <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being.
     It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle 
     stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.1 Mental health is important 
     at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.Mental 
     and physical health are equally important components of overall health.  For example, 
     depression increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly
     long-lasting conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Similarly, the presence 
     of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness.

<p>Promotion and prevention interventions work by identifying the individual, social and structural 
    determinants of mental health, and then intervening to reduce risks, build resilience and 
    establish supportive environments for mental health. Interventions can be designed for individuals,
 specific groups or whole populations.

Reshaping the determinants of mental health often requires action beyond the health sector and so
 promotion and prevention programmes should involve the education, labour, justice, transport, 
 environment, housing, and welfare sectors. The health sector can contribute significantly by embedding
  promotion and prevention efforts within health services; and by advocating, initiating and, where appropriate,
   facilitating multisectoral collaboration and coordination.</p>
